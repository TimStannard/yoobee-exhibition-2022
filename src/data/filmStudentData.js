From writing the script, I developed a vision and, in pre-production, collaborated primarily with the producer, DoP and editor to perfect it. During production and post-production, I expressed this to the rest of the crew and we worked to get the film to reflect a good portrayal of my vision. Working on this film has shown me how strong a team can be when everyone works together in a positive low-stress environment. This production process has also allowed me to form strong connections with cast/other crew members which I plan to carry over to future projects.",

Also working closely with our amazing actors to bring the film to life. Countless hours of work have been poured into this project, along with boundless dedication from all members of the crew. The final product is a great representation of this effort. Watching Other Valuable Things metamorphose into such an achievement has been a highlight of my career as a filmmaker. I cannot wait for what’s next.",
